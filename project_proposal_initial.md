Keywords: first down, win probability, NFL

Description: Analyzing third and fourth down play data from the NFL. Trying to find if two plays attemping to get a first down on 3rd and 4th converts more often than using 3rd down to set up an easier 4th down (as is commonly done on second down). Also checking at what point on the field should teams start going for it on 4th down based on win probability. 

Intellectual Merit: If clear trends are found then it would be an advantage to know for NFL teams looking to win games. 

Data Sourcing: ESPN stores play by play data which can be obtained for free. I can simply go through and record the needed data myself. Example: https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401434030
