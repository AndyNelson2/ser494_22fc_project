Keywords: first down, win probability, NFL

Description: Analyzing third and fourth down play data from the NFL. Trying to find if two plays attemping to get a first down on 3rd and 4th converts more often than using 3rd down to set up an easier 4th down (as is commonly done on second down). Also checking at what point on the field should teams start going for it on 4th down based on win probability. For example, if it is third and eight would it be better to attempt to pick up eight or more yards two times in a row or get four yards two times. 

Research Question 1: To describe the trends within the data on how the third down play effects fourth down success rate. 

Research Question 2: To predict the success rate on third down when in a go for it situation. 

Research Question 3: To defend the model for performing the prediction in research question 2.

Research Question 4: To evaluate the relationship between third down results and fourth down success. 

Intellectual Merit: If clear trends are found then it would be an advantage to know for NFL teams looking make the correct play calling decisions. 

Data Sourcing: ESPN stores play by play data which can be obtained for free. I can simply go through and record the needed data myself. Example: https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401434030
