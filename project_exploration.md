The data came from ESPN. Each set of the plays was recorded the same day as the game was played. Each game varies in how many fourth downs occur. Some games have zero fourth downs while others can have upwards of ten. 
Each row in data.txt has four sections. The first is the downs for the third down play, the second is the description for the play ran on that third down, then the third and fourth are the same but for fourth down. 
Data.txt contains all of the third and fourth down plays where the team went for it on fourth for the current NFL season.
